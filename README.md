# CrashWayland

1) Open the project on Linux in Android Studio on KDE Plasma/Wayland.
2) Wait for all dependencies to be loaded and the project to be synchronized.
3) Open MainActivity, activity_main.xml files and wait for them to load
4) Build the project (preferably run it via adb on a phone or emulator).
5) Place the cursor on the `Log.d("MyTag", "Hello")` line and press LAlt + Enter (VS keymap) or right click on this line and `Show Context Actions`.
6) Finally, kwin hangs and nothing more can be done
